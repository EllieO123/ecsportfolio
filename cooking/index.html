  <H3>Accomplishments</H3>
	  <p>I Have mastered multiple dishes such as fried rice, pumpkin rolls, chicken, and countless others.</p>
	  <h3>Timeline</h3>
	  <p>It all started when I was in kindergarten. My parents taught me how to make bean and cheese burritos and I would make them almost every day after school. Then as I got older, I would help my dad cook dinner and cook meals for myself. Now I enjoy taking cooking classes and reaching for new recipes</p>
 <h3>Why I Cook</h3>
	  <p>I've always loved cooking as a way to pass the time and to fuel my body with healthy foods. I get to spend time cooking with my family which I value. I may be a picky eater but I will always try new food.</p>
